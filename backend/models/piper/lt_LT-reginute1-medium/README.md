# lt_LT-reginute1-medium — Piper voice (Lithuanian)

![Reginutė — Lietuviškai. Vietoje. Nemokamai.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertasTa/reginute/main/docs/baneris.png)

The first Lithuanian voice for [Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl).
Latvian has been in the Piper catalogue since October 2024 and Estonian since
August 2026; Lithuanian never has.

- Language: Lithuanian (`lt_LT`)
- Voice: **female** — trained on the **LIEPA** corpus of Vilnius University,
  one professional actress (studio recordings, 5 121 utterances, ~3 h)
- Sample rate: 22 050 Hz · Quality: medium · Speakers: 1
- Files: `lt_LT-reginute1-medium.onnx` + `lt_LT-reginute1-medium.onnx.json`
  (**must stay together**) + `phonemize_lithuanian.py` with its three data
  tables `lt_kirciai.tsv`, `lt_raides.tsv` and `lt_kreipiniai.tsv`
  (see below — the voice does not speak without them) + `skaiciu_pletiklis.py`
  with `zodziai_trumpi.txt` (text normalizer) + `synth_reginute.py` (the
  recommended wrapper: sentence splitting, pauses, `normalize_audio=False`);
  `SHA256SUMS` covers all of them

## ⚠️ This voice needs its phonemizer

Lithuanian has three phonemic pitch accents, and espeak-ng places Lithuanian
stress on the **wrong syllable in roughly half of the words** when checked
against the corpus' own gold annotation. So this voice is trained with
`phoneme_type: text` on IPA plus three accent marks (`ˈ ˌ ˋ`), and the text
must be phonemized by `phonemize_lithuanian.py` together with the stress
dictionary `lt_kirciai.tsv` (189 262 word forms, built from the LIEPA
annotations and Arūnas Smaliukas' `g2p-lt-lexicon`). Two small tables sit
beside it: `lt_raides.tsv` for letter names espeak-ng gets wrong when a word
is spelled out (it calls both z and ž ʑˈee, so "Z." and "Ž." were read the
same), and `lt_kreipiniai.tsv` for the vocative - Lithuanian spells "mama"
the same whether you speak about her or to her, but accents it differently,
and a dictionary holding one entry per spelling cannot express that.

Plain Piper with a `text` voice feeds the model **raw letters, not IPA**, and
will not produce Lithuanian. A `PhonemeType.LITHUANIAN` contribution to
piper1-gpl (in the shape of `phonemize_japanese`) is being prepared; until it
lands, ship those files next to the model.

The phonemizer also normalizes text before phonemizing — numbers with the
right case endings, clock times, units and letter-by-letter abbreviations
(`skaiciu_pletiklis.py`, loaded automatically when it sits beside the module;
pass `expand_text=None` to switch it off). This matters more than it sounds:
left to itself, espeak-ng reads `5000 eurų` as *"penki tūkstantčei"* and
`15:00` as *"tūkstantis penkišimtai:"*. espeak's own phonemizer normalizes
text the same way, so this is the usual Piper arrangement, not an extra layer.

Recommended: **`normalize_audio=False`** — Piper's default (`True`) clips this
voice.

## Licence and lineage

* **Voice files: CC-BY-4.0**, derived from the
  [`meldynamics/liepa-tts`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/meldynamics/liepa-tts)
  corpus (CC-BY-4.0), published by Vilnius University.
* **Lineage, stated openly:** fine-tuned from the Piper catalogue checkpoint
  `ru_RU-irina-medium`, which is itself fine-tuned from `en_US-lessac-medium`.
  The Lessac base has an unresolved licensing question (see piper-voices
  discussion #94); the training *data* here is CC-BY-4.0, and re-basing on the
  LibriTTS-R (CC-BY) base model is planned.
* Code (`phonemize_lithuanian.py` and the tooling around it): GPL-3.0, the same
  licence as piper1-gpl.

  (Institute of Mathematics and Informatics; Faculty of Philology), with the
  **Institute of the Lithuanian Language**, the **Lithuanian University of
  Educational Sciences** (since 2019 the Education Academy of Vytautas Magnus
  University) and **Šiauliai University** (since 2021 the Šiauliai Academy of
  Vilnius University). Project lead **prof. Laimutis Telksnys**; corpus work
  and documentation **Gediminas Navickas**. The speaker — a professional
  actress — is deliberately not named here: the licence credits the corpus
  publishers, not the person, and we do not hold her own consent for this
  use. Everything anyone hears is still her.

  Lithuanian ASR fine-tuned on LIEPA-3. Measured on our bench, it cut word

## Known limitations

Listed because you will meet them anyway, and finding them yourself after
being told everything is fine is worse than reading them here.

| What | Why it happens |
|---|---|
| **Single short words sound hurried and thin** — worst with numbers read one at a time | The corpus is sentences: only 93 of 5 121 utterances are short standalone ones. „du" (two) appears alone exactly once, and as a question. Inside a sentence the same words are fine. |
| **Individual stress errors** — confirmed: `procentas`, `kilovatvalandės` | The dictionary is derived, not hand-checked word by word; in both cases the word family disagrees with itself (`procentas` vs `procentinis`). Expect more in loanwords and compounds. |
| **Homographs unsolved** — `nãmo` (of the house) vs `namõ` (homewards) | Spelled identically, differ only in accent. A word-level dictionary cannot choose; that needs sentence context. Not a bug we can fix by adding entries. |
| **Needs the phonemizer** — plain `piper -m …` will not speak Lithuanian | Architectural, not a rough edge. See the section above. |
| **`length_scale 1.30` is a judgement, not a measurement** | Chosen by ear against recordings of the original speaker. Measured afterwards on the same text: 1.2 % slower than her. Override freely if you prefer faster. |

None of these block ordinary use: the voice reads news, answers a smart
speaker and speaks multi-minute articles without a break. They are listed so
you know what you are getting — the same courtesy the author of the ASR model
above extends about his own numbers.

## For catalogue maintainers (piper-voices / piper1-gpl)

Nothing here is a new convention — each point follows something already
merged into Piper.

1. **Order:** the piper1-gpl PR adding `PhonemeType.LITHUANIAN` first, then
   the piper-voices PR. The catalogue `.onnx.json` says
   `"phoneme_type": "lithuanian"`; a Piper without the phonemizer refuses to
   load the voice with a clear error instead of feeding it raw letters. The
   same pattern as `he_IL-saspeech-medium` (`hebrew`, piper1-gpl #244),
   `zh_CN-chaowen-medium` (`pinyin`, #271) and `ja_JA-hi_fi_captain-medium`
   (`japanese`, #274): the phoneme type names a phonemizer that lives in
   Piper, and the catalogue folder holds only the model and the config.
2. **The phoneme id map** is Piper's default with one symbol appended
   (`ˋ` = 166); ˈ and ˌ are the default 120 and 121, PAD/BOS/EOS unchanged.
3. **The stress dictionary** (`lt_kirciai.tsv`, 3 MB) is resolved through
   `--data-dir` (or next to the model) and is deliberately *not* in the
   catalogue folder — no catalogue voice ships extra files. Two merged
   precedents for delivering such data: bundled in the wheel via
   `package_data` like the Hebrew models (`piper/hebrew/nakdimon.onnx`,
   20 MB, #244) — the option proposed in the piper1-gpl PR — or an archive in
   `rhasspy/piper-checkpoints/<lang>/_resources/` downloaded on first use like
   g2pW (#271/#269). Until one of them is in place, take the TSV from this
   repo.
4. **`samples/speaker_0.mp3`** was generated the way
   `piper-samples/_script/generate-samples.sh` does it (first line of
   `test_sentences/lt.txt`, sent to piper-samples separately), through the
   phonemizer. Regenerating it with a Piper that lacks the phonemizer fails;
   with a `text` config it produces noise — please keep the shipped one.

## Status

In the official Piper catalogue since 2026-09-17
([PR #103](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/discussions/103)); the
phonemizer was merged into piper1-gpl on 2026-09-15
([PR #296](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl/pull/296)) and ships with
Piper 1.9.0 — from that release plain `piper` speaks with this voice. Until then,
use the files and the wrapper in this repo.

## Used in

- [SpeakDream](https://github.com/RobertasTa/speakdream) — offline voice
  interpreter, meeting secretary and language practice for Windows; Reginutė is
  its Lithuanian voice.
- A Home Assistant voice assistant (Wyoming TTS), in daily use.
